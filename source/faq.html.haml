        %h4 Why did you decide to write another web framework?
        %p
          As always, scratching my own itch: I felt like everything else out there wasn't quite what I thought it should be.
          I wanted a framework you could use to build both one page webapps or just add it on top of a standard Rails website
          to make certain UI things smoother. Of course, for smaller things jQuery is okay, but then the problem is how do you
          scale that thing you wrote in jQuery? So, I just wanted a framework that does it right from the beginning, but that also
          doesn't scare you with all the foreign concepts, many different files, classes etc.

        %h4 And why Dart?
        %p
          Because my god, Javascript is horrible. It's getting better, but not as good as Dart already is. Additionally,
          Dart's got a great package manager and the Dartium browser with a VM, so I don't need to compile to js every time
          I change things and want to check.

        %h4 You introduce a lot of concepts. Isn't it what you were trying to avoid in other frameworks?
        %p
          I hardly introduce anything new. Components, Children and Parents, Events and Properties have all been around us for a long time.
          What those concepts mean inside NestUI doesn't really differ. Roles and Behaviors you can kind of get
          what they're for straight away without explanation. This framework isn't something I've just hacked - it's been conceived and
          rewritten some time ago, out of sight.

        %h4 Do I need to learn Dart?
        %p
          Yes, please, but it's easy. One day of reading through the manual, one day of writing code and you should be good to go.

        %h4 Is it production ready?
        %p No. But I'm working on it and am planning to release a very serious project written in NestUI.

        %h4 Why is the compiled js file so big?
        %p
          True story, it's currently several megabytes (not minfied), but that's largely because of how dart2js compiles mirrors.
          Either the Dart team or NestUI will optimize things in the future. I'd rather have something working and worry about
          optimization later.

        %h4 What's the test coverage?
        %p Pretty great, check out the <a href="/github.html">source code</a>.
